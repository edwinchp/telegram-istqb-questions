    "question": "Mr. Test has been testing software applications on mobile devices for a period of 5 years. He has a wealth of experience in testing mobile applications and achieves better results in a shorter time than others. Over several months, Mr. Test did not modify the existing automated test cases and did not create any new test cases. This leads to fewer and fewer defects being found by executing the tests. What principle of testing did Mr. Test not observe?",
    "options": [
      "Testing depends on the environment",
      "Exhaustive testing is not possible",
      "Repeating of same tests will not find new defects",
      "Defects cluster together"
